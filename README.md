# Raid Planner for Pokemon Go
This is the my second attempt at making a Raid planning application for the popular mobile game 'Pokemon Go'
This project was **never finished**. A large part of the frontend design was finished, but i moved on to other things before making the API
##### Project details
  * Focus on being mobile friendly
  * Unlike version one, it is made without a frontend framework 
    * I felt like the frameworks offered way more than what i needed
    * An opportunity to get better at the basics of Javascript, HTML & CSS
  * Uses Handlebars.js for templates
  * First time using a Task Runner(Grunt), used to automatically precompile my templates
  * Uses Express.js
